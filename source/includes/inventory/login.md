# Authentication

First of all, in order to use the application you need an account on ShopRunBack, you can [create one here](www.dashboard.shoprunback.com).

If you already have an account, simply go to this [TODO website](https://google.fr). It will generate a QRCode that contains a unique token set to expire after 24 hours.

  You can only login with a generated QRCode.

Once you have obtained a QRCode, scan it with the application.

If the token is valid you should be authentified and redirected to the application's home.

If not, a red banner saying **AUTHENTICATION FAILED** will appear briefly.

If that happens, just go back to [TODO https://google.fr](https://google.fr) and regenerate a QRCode.
